# Instagram_Giveaway
A software in C made for instagram giveaways. This software read the names from a partecipants file and select a prefixed number of winners.

This code comes in 2 different versions. dynamic_giveaway.c is a dynamic version that adapts to every combination of numbers of partecipants and gifts until the hardware memory allows it.
giveaway.c is a simplified and demonstration version. In this Read Me we will treat only the dynamic version, because the simplified one is just a subcase.

First of all, some directory indications. The partecipants file "partecipanti.txt" must be in the same directory as the source file, if not so, adjust the path as you wish.
